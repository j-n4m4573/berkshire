  - What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  It was fun. Got to actually use the information on a more practical level.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  It was nice having a navigator to be able to look up different tags and details while created the html doc.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  We did okay keeping at best practices. We did try to format a little, but overall it wasn't that challenging.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
  The good is easy to structure pages, and label importance of content for further use with CSS.

  The bad would be it's ugly presentation.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  Repition.
